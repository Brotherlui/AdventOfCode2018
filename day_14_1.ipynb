    "you discover two Elves in what appears to be a makeshift underground kitchen/laboratory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elves are trying to come up with the ultimate hot chocolate recipe;\n",
    "they're even maintaining a scoreboard which tracks the quality score (0-9) of each recipe.\n",

    "and the second Elf starts with the second recipe.\n",

    "the first with score 1 and the second with score 0. If the current recipes' scores were 2 and 3,\n",

    "To do this, the Elf steps forward through the scoreboard a number of recipes equal\n",
